# OpenDiabetesVault
OpenDiabetesVault was developed to combine several diabetes related data sources to one format.
This should mainly accelerate our work with artificial intelligence supported data analytics.

## Build the Project
Together with the code, we provide a Netbeans 8.2 project to build the program and run example code.
However, as the project code and any dependencies are in pure java, any build system should work just fine. 

## Run the Program
After compiling the program you can show the commandline help page by using the command:

```
java -jar OpenDiabetesVault.jar -h
```
